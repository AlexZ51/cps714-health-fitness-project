SETUP
-- 

1. Install a local MySQL Server https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/. The client is not needed
2. On setup:
    There will be a password prompt. Set this to "Cps714password" or else you'll need to change the config later
3. With python, install:
    pip install mysql-connector-python
4. Open file mysql_table_create.py first (this will build the db and tables)
5. mysql_connection.py will establish a client to query from.
